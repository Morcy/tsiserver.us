		<h2>Under Construction</h2>
		<p>We are sorry for the unfortunate situation, however we have a team working on this new website to launch this holiday season.</p>
		<p> We at Tactician Studios understand some frustration with consumers of our brands, such as 'GTAWWEKID', and we decided that the best solution is to make all of our programs open-source, for the most part anyways. All products shipped by our brand which are no longer in the market will be placed on this new site for free. And with this new site, we will include multiple third-party logins, so we can meet your needs.</p>
