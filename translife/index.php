				We all are born with a gender. This gender is defined by the genitals as wll as sex chromosones within ourselves. However, people often feel they were born
				the wrong gender. These people face hard challenges and obstacles to make their outside body what they feel in the inside. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This game teaches cisgenders the difficulties transgenders face everyday from the start by placing the player in a 2D reality where they face
				some of the challanges real transgender people went through. Based on how the player progresses, the point of the game is clearly stated within the
				context of this beautiful 2D world which may not seem so beautiful to the player.
