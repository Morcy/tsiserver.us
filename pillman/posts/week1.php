<h2>Week 1: Site Beginning</h2>
<p>Hey viewer, I call myself Katy Pillman, and I made this site for anyone else who is experiencing the same 
	thing as me deciding if MTF SRS is for them. I haven't had the surgery yet, but I am going to work over the next 
	10 years weekly on this site with photographs of myself. I am currently 6'4" and 200 pounds. My highschool goal is to become in a female 
	shaped body and work on socializing and communicating. I may upload mp3 files in the future weeks, but on Wednesday October 1st, 2014; I 
	am going to see a licensed clinical professional counselor for my first step of having gender indentity disorder. 
</p>
<p>
	If you are viewing in the later years, 2016 or later, I will commincate with you if you would like to ask any questions. However,
	this site must not be used to harm my employeer or any organization I am affiliated with. If such one chooses to do so, the site will most
	likely terminate, which means you may ruin lives of innocent people who experience similiar difficulties such as me. Please keep this site 
	'confindential' to yourself and your friend/family member who has gender dysphoria.   
</p>
