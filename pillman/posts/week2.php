<h2>Week 2: Short Week</h2>
<p>Hello Again. The past week I have done a lot of stuff, mostly non-related to the site. I have a doctors appointment on Monday as well as another therapy session on Thursday. I am looking forward to both of these, but here is a quick update what I have done.</p>
<p>This week has no pictures, sorry for the disappointment, however I will be posting multiple stuff next week. Thanks for tuning into this week, and hope you continue for the rest of the journey.</p>
