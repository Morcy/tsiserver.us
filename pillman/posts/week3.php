<h2>Week 3: A Big Week</h2>
<p>Hello Girls!</p>
<p>Okay, so this week I became a Microsoft Developer! I am so hyped about this, and can't wait to start gaining reputation for my business. On the otherhand, mentally I was perscribed depression medication. This is not permanent, as people just want to see if it affects my mood. Other than that, my second therapy session was a lot better and I started to come out of my shell. Also, I decided to not do media content for every week, as I do not have the resources to upload them at the moment. </p>
<p>I am now available to <a href="mailto:ask@tacticianstudios.com">email anyone with questions or comments</a>, and am working on this site this next week.</p>
