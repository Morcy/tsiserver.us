				<h2>About Katy Pillman</h2>
				
				<p>Katy Pillman was born May 18th, 1998. She currently occupies as a software engineer for Tactician Studios LLC. However, 
					she not always had such an amazing life. Being born as a male and having <a href="http://www.webmd.com/sex/gender-identity-disorder" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom:1px dashed blue; ">Gender Dysphoria</a>. 
					With this condition, her life is more difficult to survive than any other average human being. The purpose of this site is for the weekly progress of her life and the progression on becoming part of the female society.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Early Childhood</h2>
				
				<p>Katy was born as Nathan Pillman in 1998. She wasn't an typical american child. Her father left the family in her first few years of life, with a complete stranger marrying her mother when she was five years of age. This man was not the nicest person to her. She was abused on a daily basis for the next 10 years of her life.
					This in fact as we believe tourturized Katy from socializing and creating her into a quite child. </p>
				
				<h2>Teenager Years</h2>
				
				<p>Katy kept her secret of feeling like a girl afraid others would judge her. With this, she did not date anyone nor create many relationships. She was also peer-presured into High School football team to release previous Anger issues of her childhood, but she did not like football. Nor did she ever like the typical male hobbies
					as thrusting during sex. She didn't feel it was her. She was a girl inside a boy body, but she didn't want to keep being a boy for the rest of her life. Starting around her 16th birthday, she started going by Katy Pillman with her small group of friends. 
					She is currently growing out her hair from cutting it for <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140927205032/http://www.hsgamecenter.com/kansas/school/shawnee-mission-northwest-cougars" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none; border-bottom:1px dashed blue; ">Varsity Football</a>.</p>
			
				<h2>Life after High School</h2>
				
				<p>TBD. The skies the limit, but we will see how much further we can go.</p>
