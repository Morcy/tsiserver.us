A dream with me inside a burning home all alone and stuck. This memory is still kinda blurry just as it was when I woke up from it. The next memory after that was the night my brother and I left the home to go to the playground up the road. Ebbin and I unlocked the deadlock of the front door and left to go up the road to the playground. We were up there for around an half hour and there was a police officer that came ask us where our parents were. It was very dark outside and he took us to his cruiser and open his trunk and gave us a stuffed animal. After that, I remember walking down the road to see several police cruisers outside my home and my mom coming home from work. That is the end of the memory, as I do not remember much after that moment until moving to Louisburg and having another little brother come home. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For much of my childhood, it was moving almost every 6 months. I never stayed in one area for long, and got use to moving I lacked social experiences like making friends. Starting from Louisburg Kansas, I moved to Fort Scott KS and attended KIndergarten there. After a few months, we moved to Millinocket Maine. Which was a dramatic change for me, because everything I knew was all about Kansas. But we didn&rsquo;t stay up in Maine long, and went back to Fort Scott. I stayed a little while in Fort Scott but ended up in Iola Kansas. After a while in Iola, we moved to Lenexa and stayed a few months before moving to Lansing. At Lansing, my mom and her husband thought about getting a divorce, and she left for a while with Ebbin and I and we lived in Lenexa with my grandparents. But she was in denial and made up with her husband and he took us to Maine again, but to Lincoln. We moved to Lincoln, and I had to go to school longer than if I had to stay in Kansas. We lived there for not long until we moved to Birch Harbor on the east coast of Maine. After a year there, we moved to Hancock Maine when my mom officially was finished living with her ex-husband. They &lsquo;broke-up&rsquo; while my brother Ebbin and I were visiting my grandparents for a month in Kansas. During that vacation, we visited California as well for a week. It was fun while it lasted, but we went back to Maine not knowing what had happened. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my mom left her husband, we had nowhere to go. We moved into an old apartment right next to the school I went to. The school was a small school. Around 50 students per grade k-8. I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy school. School has always been boring and usually pointless as I don&rsquo;t learn anything I don&rsquo;t already know or something that is completely useless to know. So at school, I would write stories about almost anything. Apparently, because I wrote a story like Steven Kings having a plot of a murderer, I was put into a mental hospital. I strongly don&rsquo;t still understand what is wrong with writing stories of murder, they force you to read stories about it at school but you can&rsquo;t write about it. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the mental hospital, I did not relate to anyone there. They were all there because of drugs and crime activities. They were nothing I would compare myself to. My stay there was boring, but during my stay they asked questions I had no idea about genders. First they asked if I was ever circumcised, and at that time I was 12 and had no idea what that meant. They also asked other questions about stuff I had no idea what they were talking about. I just kept saying &lsquo;No&rsquo; or &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;. They also asked if I thought my life would be easier as the other gender, the first time anyone asked me that and I shooked my head no, and just wanted to get out for Thanksgiving, which I wasn&rsquo;t released until December. &nbsp;After my release, it was difficult going back to school after being absent for a month. While at that school, I realized I was not like the other boys. They knew all about sports and hunting. I have little knowledge of both subjects and it was difficult to be friends with them not knowing popular NBA stars or NFL players. At this time, I know a little more, but it is completely boring to me. They also talked about Halo, a video game, which I find pointless and boring. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following April, my family and I moved back to Kansas. I went to School for a month after moving back but could not remember classmates from three years past. &nbsp;However, for Eighth grade I started fresh in a new school. I went to Mill Creek Middle School, and I honestly disliked everyone there. I got in trouble throughout the school year being suspended for various reasons. However, near the end of the school year, I got suspended for being assaulted. Apparently to the administrations at the school, if you get beaten up by someone, you get suspended even though you never put a finger on anybody. The principle never could give a valid reason to my suspension. However, I am pretty sure he was not principle the following year, as also my previous principal at Hancock left the following year I moved back to Kansas. But after Eight grade, I moved again and started going to Shawnee Mission Northwest High School. I was barely ever in a Principle&rsquo;s office for ridiculous reasons. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I am at school now, I don&rsquo;t really pay attention to the teachers. Most of the stuff they teach is stuff I already know or stuff that I find useless to know. My Freshman year, in my World Regional Studies class, I disliked the teacher. I corrected her when she made a mistake explaining timezones and she couldn&rsquo;t accept that she made a mistake in front of the whole class. She basically admitted that she may or may not be teaching stuff correctly, so after that day I sat there studying psychology sort-of. I commonly try to figure out what others are thinking about. Then some-how I start to think about science and the 4th dimension, which I am doing now as I type this, but my thinking is way more better than communicating it. During my Math classes at school, I do not do my assignments, just sit in the class paying little attention to the teacher. I then ace the tests. This also happened when I took Physics my Sophomore year. &nbsp;Now people in High School I barely simulate to. Typically, all the boys talk about sex, or about Anime if they are &lsquo;lame&rsquo;. The girls talk about movies typically, and I haven&rsquo;t seen most of them. I could talk about the awesome Frozen movie, and did most of my Sophomore year. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My school life is boring, and I am typically not mentally there. Many things I think about are being a female, outer space, and my past. I can get further into the past when I am heavily thinking, and my imagination sometimes pulls me away from reality, referring to my science-fiction thoughts. I can also remeber various dreams of mine and I can now go further into the past when I played with my mom&rsquo;s makeup and gave a makeover to the television set. Earlier than that, I had a dream. And in that dream I was a female. This dream has been stuck in my head hidden away. I was hiding under a sink, hiding from this man. I was wearing a red blouse and had long brunette hair. My dreams never have mirrors, but I can commonly see myself in my dream. Some of my dreams are very awkward, and I can not control what happens in these dreams. &nbsp;Most dreams that are stuck in my head are nightmarish, but one is unique. I was living in this old home in Iola, Kansas. I don&rsquo;t know if this was reality or was a dream, but a woman that was a ghost came out of the attic which was in my attic. I had seen her before in my childhood, but this time she was yellow. The first time I saw her, I was dreaming when I was 2 or 1, and was put in the stairway to be punished, and there was a floor above the basement. It was a hallway, and it was very dark. The exact woman was there but was smaller and blue. These are crazy dreams I have had, but are ones I remember. I also had a dream of being arrested, but I woke up as soon as I was handcuffed. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking about my dreams pulls up memories of real life. The latest thought stuck in my head was fire-extinguishing my apartment when I was around 4. Ebbin and I found the fire extinguisher and sprayed it all over the apartment. In my room that night, I remember having this &lsquo;boy doll&rsquo;, which I loved playing with when I wasn&rsquo;t playing video games. My childhood I had a few boy dolls which were army soldiers and a police officer. I did not have any girl dolls, and I always wanted a girl doll, whenever I could have a chance at the store, I would look at the Barbie dolls. When I didn&rsquo;t play with the dolls, I would role-play with toy cars. I had a large imagination with these cars creating worlds that seemed real. My brothers played with army action figures, but I was not interested in them as far as I can remember. Later in life, when I was 8 or so, I learned about WWE. I loved WWE and still have passion for it. Some kids bullied me for liking WWE saying that it was fake and I was gay for liking it, but I honestly didn&rsquo;t care. My favorite wrestler is and always will be John Cena, and no one is going to change my opinion about it. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my life, I have had a journey which is only starting. I didn&rsquo;t really understand the differences between boys and girls until I was 10, and still didn&rsquo;t really know the difference between the two. I believe the first time I heard about female and male differences, other than breasts, was when I was 11-ish. The first time I really acted on my feeling of being a girl inside was during my highschool freshman year. I bought girl underwear and</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;nylon tights. I kept them secret in my dresser, and threw them away eventually after my mom found girl shorts with underwear in them with a maxi-pad, I grabbed when I was in 8th grade. With that in my mind, I had earlier put on girl lipstick and makeup when I was on the summer vacation with my grandparents. I was in the bathroom and put on the lipstick and washed it off when I was done. Remembering of that, I had an experience even before that putting on a friend&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s underwear. I was 12 I believe, summer break of 6th grade, and I liked wearing it, even though it was just 5 minutes. </span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2011, I played my PlayStation 3, (PS3), almost every day. I played Grand Theft Auto IV almost every day and was involved in role-playing clans of pretending to be police officers online with others. While part of this community, I met this homosexual guy, Alan, and he was a great friend. He was easy to talk to, and I could have emotional conversations with him. Sadly, he got in a car accident and lost most of his memory, I had lost a close friend it seemed. Other than him, I usually talk with girls or younger kids. This one kid, Koy, was one of my bestfriends. He was comical, and wouldn&rsquo;t talk bad about females like using the term hoe or bitch, for a while at least. That is something about myself too, I highly respect females and have changed some men minds on respecting them as much as I do. It is hard to explain how, but basically they know when they offended someone when I do not reply to them. But Koy was a good kid, until he hit puberty and talked about sex all the time like the others. So I really only have females on my friends list, and most of them call me Katy, and they do know I was born a boy. My two favorite friends on it are Amanda and Videl. They are my awesome besties and support me when I need help.</span></p></body></html>
